## Simple Syntax Checker for C

This is going to be a rudimentary syntax checker for the "C" language. Just cannot figure out a problem, well that's what programming is all about. Problem solving. Hopefully, I can get this working the way I want. It needs to check the whole thing instead of checking just part of it at a time. Haven't figured out how to do that just yet. But, I will figure it out.
